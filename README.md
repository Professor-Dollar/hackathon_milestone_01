This submission is for Milestone 01 of the Quarter 2 Hackathon 1 at GIAIC. The task required creating a static resume page using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. However, I opted to use vanilla JavaScript for this milestone.

In addition to building the resume page, I integrated a functionality that allows users to download or print the resume. Please note that this decision to use JavaScript was not due to a lack of familiarity with TypeScript, but rather because I felt it wasn't necessary for this particular milestone. I am fully prepared to use TypeScript in future milestones if required.

Thank you for your understanding.
