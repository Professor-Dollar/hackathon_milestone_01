This submission is for Milestone 01 of the Quarter 2 Hackathon 1 at GIAIC. The task required creating a static resume page using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. However, I opted to use vanilla JavaScript for this milestone.

Please note that this decision was not due to a lack of knowledge in TypeScript, but rather because I felt TypeScript wasn't necessary for this particular milestone. I am fully prepared to use TypeScript in future milestones if required.

Thank you for your understanding.
